Prerequisites: Local Project Files
Before running the pipeline, you need two files committed to the main branch of your Azure DevOps Git repository:
1. requirements.txt (Dependencies)
This file tells the pipeline which Python packages to install (pandas, numpy, requests) so your Week 2 script can run.
Plaintext
# requirements.txt
pandas
numpy
requests
2. run_pipeline.py (Execution Script)
This is a conceptual Python file that combines the core logic of your Week 2 script and prints the final result, which the pipeline will log.
Python
# run_pipeline.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import requests
from datetime import datetime

# --- NOTE: Replace this with your actual Week 2 data fetching/processing logic ---
def main():
    print("--- Starting Supply Chain Monitoring Script ---")
    
    # Simulate loading data
    data = [
        {"order_id": 103, "supplier_id": "S001", "quantity": 250, "delivery_date": "2025-10-23", "price": 10.00},
        {"order_id": 107, "supplier_id": "S003", "quantity": 90, "delivery_date": "2025-09-01", "price": 45.00}
    ]
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Process data (simulate key Week 2 transformation)
    df['delivery_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['delivery_date']) 
    df['delay_days'] = (pd.Timestamp(datetime.now()) - df['delivery_date']).dt.days
    df['is_delayed'] = np.where(df['delay_days'] > 0, 1, 0)

    # Log the results (Logs the results and marks completion)
    print("\n--- FINAL PROCESSED RESULTS (Logged) ---")
    print(df[['order_id', 'supplier_id', 'delay_days', 'is_delayed']].head())
    print("\n*** Supply Chain Script Execution Complete ***")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
